The result is your Charge value and represents the number of times you may attempt to use Arcane Magic. Once your counter is depleted, you will not be able to use Arcane Magic again without penalties until you have completed at least 6 hours of uninterrupted Complete Rest (e.g. sleep) and 1 full hour of focused meditation. Without this feat, characters may attempt to use Arcane Magic only 1d4 times each day. During a combat round, you must reduce your Ticker value by one each time that you also decrease your Charge value. ",
