The Dur and their culture have had some degree of impact on every humanoid culture in existence.  The Dur are a race of dedicated, hardworking, hard fighting, and hard drinking, craftsmen without equal.  On the average, dwarves tend to be short and stocky with bandy legs and quick, clever fingers.  In appearance, they have broad, heavy faces with rounded ears, lots of hair, and large noses.  Dur are tough and strong with a near legendary ability to withstand much physical strain.  In addition, they have a well-deserved reputation for being short tempered, suspicious, and rude to strangers. But,they will also form intensely loyal and generous friendships with those they have accepted as worthwhile.",

Certainly, most of their cultural traditions have survived for many thousands of years. In appearance, N'Athi tend to be slender with fine, almost delicate features and long, dexterous fingers.  Their eyes are always large and almond shaped.  Their ears are narrow and sharply pointed.  All elves have finely honed senses.  They are observant and have keenly analytical minds.  As a result, most elves are thoughtful and generaly opposed to taking action without comprehensive thought and planning.  N'Athi may share a minor type of mystic bond with other members of their family and, to some extent, other elves.  As a result, they tend to have some limited empathic telepathy with those for whom they hold such bonds.  They know, vaguely, the direction in which any family member is located at any given time and have a general impression of that member’s well-being.",
