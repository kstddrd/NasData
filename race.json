The Dur and their culture have had some degree of impact on every culture in existence at this time.  The Dur are a race of dedicated, hardworking, hard fighting, and hard drinking, craftsmen without equal.  On the average, dwarves tend to be short and stocky with short legs but clever fingers.  They have broad, heavy features with rounded ears, lots of hair, and large noses.  Dwarves are tough and strong with a near legendary ability to withstand much physical strain.  Dwarves have a well-deserved reputation for being short tempered, suspicious, and thirsty; but they also form intensely loyal friendships with those they like.",

Certain physiological features are typical of all elves.  All elves tend to be slender with fine, almost delicate features and long, dexterous fingers.  Elven eyes are always large, slanted, and almond shaped.  Their ears are larger and sharply pointed.  All elves have excellent senses.  All elves are observant and have analytical minds.  As a result, most elves are thoughtful and opposed to action without comprehensive thought and planning.  Elves are prone to empathy and share a minor type of mystic bond with other members of their family and, to some extent, other elves.  As a result, Elves can share deep emotions and feelings with members of their families.  They know, vaguely, the direction in which any family member is located at any given time and have a general impression of that member’s well-being.  Elves gain a +2 bonus to all ‘Social Skills’ roll results that involve other Elves.",
